# T1209 - Winlogon Helper DLL
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1209)
<blockquote>
The Windows Time service (W32Time) enables time synchronization across and within domains.[1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/windows-time-service/windows-time-service-top) W32Time time providers are responsible for retrieving time stamps from hardware/network resources and outputting these values to other network clients.[2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SysInfo/time-provider)

Time providers are implemented as dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are registered in the subkeys of <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\.</code> [2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SysInfo/time-provider) The time provider manager, directed by the service control manager, loads and starts time providers listed and enabled under this key at system startup and/or whenever parameters are changed. [2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SysInfo/time-provider)

Adversaries may abuse this architecture to establish Persistence, specifically by registering and enabling a malicious DLL as a time provider. Administrator privileges are required for time provider registration, though execution will run in context of the Local Service account.[3](https://github.com/scottlundgren/w32time)

## Assumptions
We assum attacker is on the system and has a Administrator priviledge.

## Execution:
* Add new provider to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\
* w32tm /config 

## Detection:
* Enable Audit system time change
* Sysmon event 12 , 13 (for registery event)
* Monitor Registery enteries related to winw32tm
* use Osquery for registery Key to monitor
  * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\
* use of w32tm.exe 


### Visibility
* Monitor Registery changes with SYSMON, Osquery
* Use of w32tm

### Filter / Correlation in Splunk

```
"w32tm" OR "timeproviders"  OR ("EventCode=12" OR "EventCode=13")
```
