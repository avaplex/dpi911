# T1201 - Password Policy Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1201)
<blockquote>Password policies for networks are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110). An adversary may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network. This would help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts).

Password policies can be set and discovered on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems.[1](https://superuser.com/questions/150675/how-to-display-password-policy-information-for-a-user-ubuntu),[2](https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/18574/user-password-policies-on-non-ad-machines)


## Assumptions
Attacker tries to find a password policy by running the <code>net accounts</code> in commandline

## Execution:

```
net accounts
```
![Net Accounts](https://github.com/avaplex/dpi911/blob/master/images/T1201-1.JPG)
## Detection:
* Enable Audit, Sysmon event 4, "net  accounts"
* Monitor for password discovery
* Windows Event 4793	The Password Policy Checking API was called
* Windows Event	4723	An attempt was made to change an account's password
* [Read Mitre ATT&CK for more Detection info](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1201)

### Visibility
* Events 4793, 4723
* Sysmon Event type 4
* "net  accounts"

### Filter / Correlation in Splunk
 
```
(commandline:"net  accounts*" AND "eventtype=4") OR "eventcode=4793" OR "eventcode=4723" 
```
