# T1116 - Code Signing
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1116)
<blockquote>
Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a binary from the developer and a guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing) However, adversaries are known to use code signing certificates to masquerade malware and tools as legitimate binaries [2](http://www.thesafemac.com/new-signed-malware-called-janicab/). 
The certificates used during an operation may be created, forged, or stolen by the adversary.[3](https://securelist.com/why-you-shouldnt-completely-trust-files-signed-with-digital-certificates/68593/),[4](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/how-attackers-steal-private-keys-digital-certificates)

Code signing to verify software on first run can be used on modern Windows and macOS/OS X systems. It is not used on Linux due to the decentralized nature of the platform. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing)

Code signing certificates may be used to bypass security policies that require signed code to execute on a system.
