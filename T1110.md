# T1110 - Brute Force
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1110)
<blockquote>Adversaries may use brute force techniques to attempt access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are obtained.

[Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) to obtain password hashes may only get an adversary so far when [Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1075) is not an option. Techniques to systematically guess the passwords used to compute hashes are available, or the adversary may use a pre-computed rainbow table. Cracking hashes is usually done on adversary-controlled systems outside of the target network. (Citation: Wikipedia Password cracking)

Adversaries may attempt to brute force logins without knowledge of passwords or hashes during an operation either with zero knowledge or by attempting a list of known or possible passwords. This is a riskier option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies. (Citation: Cylance Cleaver)

A related technique called password spraying uses one password, or a small list of passwords, that matches the complexity policy of the domain and may be a commonly used password. Logins are attempted with that password and many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords. (Citation: BlackHillsInfosec Password Spraying)</blockquote>

## Assumptions
Attacker does not have a access to system but use a known username or user name he assum exist and perform a bruteforce or dictionary attack to gain access to system. he might use a share drive or other application to perform a bruteforce. If attacker already have access to a password hash file and perform a bruteforce, obviously it will not going to be detected.

## Execution:
[Test using Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1110/T1110.md)

## Detection:
* Monitor Authentication log for failure login
* Monitor many share login attempts
* [Read Mitre ATT&CK for more Detection info](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1110)

### Visibility
* Windows event log 
* Event Code 4625: Windows	4625	An account failed to log on
* Event Code 4797: An attempt was made to query the existence of a blank password for an account
* Event Code 4770: A Kerberos service ticket was renewed
* Shared Login attempt, IPC$ / Sysmon Event Type=4

### Filter / Correlation in Splunk

```
("eventcode=4740" OR "eventcode=4625" OR "eventcode=4797") OR ("IPC$" AND "Eventtype=4") 
```
