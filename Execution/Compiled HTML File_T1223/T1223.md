# T1223 - Compiled HTML File
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1223)
<blockquote>Compiled HTML files (.chm) are commonly distributed as part of the Microsoft HTML Help system. CHM files are compressed compilations of various content such as HTML documents, images, and scripting/web related programming languages such VBA, JScript, Java, and ActiveX. (Citation: Microsoft HTML Help May 2018) CHM content is displayed using underlying components of the Internet Explorer browser (Citation: Microsoft HTML Help ActiveX) loaded by the HTML Help executable program (hh.exe). (Citation: Microsoft HTML Help Executable Program)

Adversaries may abuse this technology to conceal malicious code. A custom CHM file containing embedded payloads could be delivered to a victim then triggered by [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204). CHM execution may also bypass application whitelisting on older and/or unpatched systems that do not account for execution of binaries through hh.exe. (Citation: MsitPros CHM Aug 2017) (Citation: Microsoft CVE-2017-8625 Aug 2017)</blockquote>

  
## Assumptions
Adversary send a custom CHM file through email or malicious application run by the user on local system.

## Execution:
[Test using Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T11223/T1223.md)

## Detection:
* Monitor execution of hh.exe
* [Read Mitre ATT&CK for more Detection info](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1223)

### Visibility
* Windows event log
* hh.exe and .chm
* Command line / Powershell activity

### Filter / Correlation in Splunk

```
("EventCode=1" AND "Image:*hh.exe" AND "CommandLine:*" AND "ParentImage:*cmd.exe") OR ("EventCode=1" AND "Image:*hh.exe" AND "*.chm")
```
or
```
"hh.exe" AND "EventCode=1" AND "cmd.exe" AND "*.chm"
```
