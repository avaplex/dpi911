# T1017 - Application Deployment Software
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1004)
<blockquote>
Adversaries may deploy malicious software to systems within a network using application deployment systems employed by enterprise administrators. The permissions required for this action vary by system configuration; local credentials may be sufficient with direct access to the deployment server, or specific domain credentials may be required. However, the system may require an administrative account to log in or to perform software deployment.

Access to a network-wide or enterprise-wide software deployment system enables an adversary to have remote code execution on all systems that are connected to such a system. The access may be used to laterally move to systems, gather information, or cause a specific effect, such as wiping the hard drives on all endpoints.

## Assumptions
Attacker has a initial access to some systems on network and will attempt to make use of PowerShell to remotely install software.


## Execution:
Use PowerShell to run software installation silently from a remote system

## Detection:
* Use sysmon and windows event to detect
* Monitor PowerShell for installation of Windows Remote Management
* Monitor PowerShell for Start-process commands with silent arguments
* Monitor remote account login activity
* [More info on detection from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1004)

### Visibility
* Sysmon Event ID 8: CreateRemoteThread
* Windows Security Log Event ID 4624: An account was successfully logged on

### Filter / Correlation in Splunk
