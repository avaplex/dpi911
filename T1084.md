# T1084 - Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1084)
<blockquote>
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) can be used to install event filters, providers, consumers, and bindings that execute code when a defined event occurs. Adversaries may use the capabilities of WMI to subscribe to an event and execute arbitrary code when that event occurs, providing persistence on a system. Adversaries may attempt to evade detection of this technique by compiling WMI scripts. [1](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/wmi-persistence) Examples of events that may be subscribed to are the wall clock time or the computer's uptime.
