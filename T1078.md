# T1078 - Valid Accounts
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1078)
<blockquote>
Adversaries may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account using Credential Access techniques or capture credentials earlier in their reconnaissance process through social engineering for means of gaining Initial Access.

Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.

Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using pre-defined account names and passwords, as a means for persistence through backup access in case other means are unsuccessful.

The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.

## Assumptions
We assume that the attacker has some credential already in hand then uses them to create other valid accounts.

## Execution:
* net user /add newuser password
* Other suspecious activity is depend on the network

## Detection:
* Monitor for suspecious account activities (login at night, multiple login, login from unknown ip)
* Enable Audits of accounts (Local or Domain) 
* Monitor use of "net user" command
* Monitor changes to account objects
* Enable Windows Audit Policy
* Event ID 4720 A user account was created
* Event ID 4722 A user account was enabled
* Event ID 4738 A user account was changed
* Event ID 4741 A computer account was created
* Event ID 4742 A computer account was changed
* Event ID 4767 A user account was unlocked
* Monitor Login activity with running binaries

### Visibility
* Windows event log
* Enable Windows event log , Audit 
* Account manipulation with relation to other events
* Changes to account objects
* Use of "net user", "wmic", etc.

### Filter / Correlation in Splunk

```
"CommandLine:*" OR "eventcode=4720" OR "eventcode=4722" OR "eventcode=4738" OR "eventcode=4741" OR "eventcode=4742" OR "eventcode=4767" OR "net*user" OR "wmic" 
```
