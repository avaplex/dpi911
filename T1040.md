# T1040 - Network Sniffing
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1040)
<blockquote>Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.

Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as [LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1171), can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.

Network sniffing may also reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (ex: IP addressing, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for follow-on Lateral Movement and/or Defense Evasion activities.</blockquote>

## Assumptions
Attacker has admin or special priviledge to run a sniffing program or install one. 

## Execution:
[Test using Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1040/T1040.md)

```
tcpdump -c 5 -nnni eth0
tshark -c 5 -i eth0
```

## Detection:
* Monitor for ARP Spoof
* Monitor for Network sniffing tools
* Monitor For IP Spoof
* [Read Mitre ATT&CK for more Detection info](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1040)

### Visibility
* IDS / Firewall IP Spoof Alert
* ARP Spoof Alert
* If possible monitor interfaces in snif / promiscuous mode
* Log and Monitor any use or installation of any sniffing tools (such as wireshark, tcpdump, etc)

### Filter / Correlation in Splunk

```
tshark.exe OR wireshark.exe OR tcpdump.exe OR npcap.exe OR windump.exe OR dumpcap.exe OR USBPcapCMD.exe OR rawshark
```
